# MoneylionDynamicFormBuilder
As part of the hiring process for MoneyLion, I was given an assignment by the hiring manager that has to be completed within 24 hours. This project is a React Native application that serves as a dynamic form builder, where users can determine the name and type of the field entries on the form.

## Details on the current build
1. You can add multiple entries to the form that you want to generate
2. You can choose 4 entry types which are Text, Number, Boolean and Checkbox
3. You can remove an entry at any index 
4. You are able to generate a simple view of a form once you have added the entries to the Entry list
5. Due to the time constraint, I was not able to add in the function to allow users to edit their options for the Checkbox and Boolean options. 

## To run the application
1. Be sure to run `npm install` first to download all the dependencies
2. Because this project uses react-native-vector-icons, do run `npx react-native link react-native-vector-icons` to link the assets to the project
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` to view application
